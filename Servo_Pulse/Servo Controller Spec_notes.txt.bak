requirements and specs for servo controller 

Cockpit display/control:
	Provides UI, PID and direct servo control functions. 
1.) fits in 2 1/14 instrument hole
2.) has a LCD display, monochrome
3.) capacitive touch sensor for buttons.
4.) allows manual override and setpoint adjust
5.) voltage regulator for 5V 
6.) don't use VSS/VDD for ADC ref
7.) controls multiple servos from multiple temp sensors 
8.) Switch mode PS? Enough current for multiple servos.
9.) LM 334 based temp sensor, current loop.

Wiring for servo pulse based system for each node: 
	Ground, , plus 5V, Servo Pulse, Temp current. A max of 4 nodes per DB15 if sharing of VCC or GND pins 
	Controller needs to subregulate 5V for all servos 
  

Wiring for LIN-bus  based system:
	+12V Battery, LIN, GND
	
Controller in cockpit
	Is LIN master node, 
	provides +12V, LIN,GND through Firewall.
	Provides PID and UI functions only
	

Slave  Node:
		One per Servo/temp probe.
		Reads temp probe(s) and sends data to Master
		Has a built in reference for the ADC, or uses i2c/TMP100 probe for Temp
		Makes servo pulse from LIN data from master
		Provides subregulated 5V for Servo, Linear reg ok
